          There are lots of tricky things with React Native, partially because of iOS and Android ecosystems. There are lots of unanswered questions hanging around, or just people struggling to find answers for problems that may seem trivial to us. This conference is the place they can visit, get answers to questions and go home start writing their next cool startup. And thatâ€™s the real purpose of the conference. I am excited for Callstack.io, the company I've founded, to be part of this transformation.
